   <h1 id="A"> Top 3 most famouse vampire case</h1>
    <h2>1.Mercy Brown</h2>
    <img src="Mercy_Brown.jpg"
    height="200">
    <p>In Exeter, Rhode Island, several members of George and Mary Brown's family suffered a sequence of tuberculosis infections in the final two decades of the 19th century. Tuberculosis was called "consumption" at the time, and was a devastating and much-feared disease.

        The mother, Mary Eliza, was the first to die of the disease, followed in 1884 by their eldest daughter, Mary Olive, according to her grave stone. In 1891, daughter Mercy and son Edwin also contracted the disease.[1] Friends and neighbors of the family believed that one of the dead family members was a vampire, although they did not use that name, and had caused Edwin's illness. This was in accordance with threads of contemporary folklore, which linked multiple deaths in one family to undead activity. Consumption was a poorly understood condition at the time and the subject of much superstition.
        
        George Brown was persuaded to give permission to exhume several bodies of his family members. Villagers, the local doctor, and a newspaper reporter exhumed the bodies on March 17, 1892.[1] The bodies of both Mary and Mary Olive exhibited the expected level of decomposition, so they were thought not to be the cause. However, the corpse of a daughter, Mercy, exhibited almost no decomposition, and still had blood in the heart. This was taken as a sign that the young woman was undead and the agent of young Edwin's condition. Her lack of decomposition was more likely due to her body being stored in freezer-like conditions in an above-ground crypt during the two months following her death.
        
        As superstition dictated, Mercy's heart and liver were burned, and the ashes were mixed with water to create a tonic and was given to the sick Edwin to drink, as an effort to resolve his illness and stop the influence of the undead. The young man died two months later.[1] What remained of Mercy's body was buried in the cemetery of the Baptist Church in Exeter after being desecrated.
        
        In the end, the father, George Brown, was one of very few never to contract tuberculosis, living until 1922, just long enough to see bacteriologists Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin discover the BCG vaccine which is used to reduce risk of severe tuberculosis.</p>
     <h2>2.Elizabeth Báthory</h2>

     id="a"

     width="200">
     <p>Elizabeth Báthory, born in 1560 in Hungary, was a powerful noblewoman who became infamous for torturing and killing hundreds of young girls, with some claiming the number of victims reached around 600. Witnesses said she beat, burned, mutilated, and even bit pieces off her victims. Over time, legends grew that she bathed in the blood of virgins to keep herself young and beautiful, although modern historians believe these blood-bathing stories might have been exaggerated later to make her seem even more monstrous. After a royal investigation, she was arrested in 1610 but, due to her noble status, was not executed—instead, she was imprisoned inside her own castle, where she died in 1614. Some believe she may have been framed by political enemies who wanted her wealth, but regardless, her story remains one of the most gruesome in history and has deeply influenced vampire myths.

     <h2>3.Peter Kürten</h2>
     <img src="Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-11502,_Polizeiaufnahme_eines_Massenmörders.jpg"
     height="200">
     <p>Peter Kürten, often called the "Vampire of Düsseldorf," was one of Germany’s most infamous serial killers. Born in 1883, Kürten's early life was marked by violence and abuse, which shaped his sadistic tendencies. By the late 1920s, he had begun his killing spree in Düsseldorf, targeting women and children. His crimes were brutal and terrifying — he would strangle, stab, or slash his victims, often drinking their blood afterward, which earned him the "vampire" label. The satisfaction of instilling fear and causing pain seemed to drive him, as he confessed to returning to crime scenes to relive the terror.

        Kürten’s attacks spanned from 1929 to 1930, and the city was gripped by fear as the police struggled to find the killer. He would often lure his victims by pretending to be injured or in distress. His murders were calculated and systematic, and he exhibited a chilling sense of control over his actions. Many of his victims were attacked in their homes, where he would enter undetected and strike.
        
        After a series of murders, Kürten’s reign of terror came to an end when he confessed to his wife, who turned him in. His arrest in 1930 led to a media frenzy, as the true extent of his depravity was revealed. Kürten admitted to at least nine murders and dozens of assaults, though some believe there were more.
        
        He was tried and convicted, and in 1931, Peter Kürten was executed by guillotine. His case continues to captivate criminal historians, and his sadistic behavior, combined with his bloodlust, has led to his enduring status as one of the most horrifying real-life figures in criminal history.
